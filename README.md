## Custom React UI components

We recommend you to use free [Hubleto React UI](https://github.com/hubleto/react-ui) library to develop rich data management features into your apps.

Run commands below to install it:

```
cd /var/www/html/hubleto
./bin/prepare-assets.sh
npm run build
```

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to Hubleto core, follow these steps to setup your development environment:

  1. Create folder for Hubleto codebase, e.g. `mkdir /var/www/html/hubleto-core`
  2. Fork [`hubleto/erp`](https://github.com/hubleto/erp), [`hubleto/framework`](https://github.com/hubleto/framework), [`hubleto/assets`](https://github.com/hubleto/assets), [`hubleto/react-ui`](https://github.com/hubleto/react-ui) into `hubleto-core` folder.
     *Note: If you have access to repository with enterprise apps, you may fork this as well.*
  4. Symlink these forks by running following commands: `cd /var/www/html/hubleto` + `./bin/setup-dev-env.sh ../hubleto-core`
     *Note: the `setup-dev-env.sh` takes one argument - relative path to your Hubleto codebase*
  5. Initialize Hubleto: `php hubleto init`

Now, your `http://localhost/hubleto` will be rendered using the codebase in `hubleto-core`.

> TIP: Use `npm run watch` to automatically compile assets on every change in the UI.
